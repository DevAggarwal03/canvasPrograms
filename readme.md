# Welcome to the Repo

<p>Here I will be storing all the codes I write along the journey of learning HTML Canvas. A huge thanks to Chris Courses on YouTube for teaching all kinds of 
things that can be done using Canvass.........</p>

# info:
<h3>1_basic, and 2_basic are just a practice file just to get some of my canvas basics down.</h3>
<h3>3_basic is a program where many bubbles float around in the canvas and every bubble bulges if they are inside a 50px radius of the cursor</h3>
<h3>4_basic is a program that generates bubbles(circles) whenever the mouse is moved (this one is the first authentic/original program I have coded after learning everything from the above programs</h3>
